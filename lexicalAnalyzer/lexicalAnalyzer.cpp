/*
 * Scanner Source File
 * -------------------
 * This file implements the lexical analyzer (scanner) for the language,
 * providing the `lex()` function to tokenize input.
 *
 * The scanner reads characters from the input and groups them into meaningful
 * tokens for the parser to process. It handles keywords, identifiers,
 * literals, operators, and other language constructs.
